# halo-hardware-assembler-language-opensource


Our goal is to completely rid ourselves of vendor platform dependencies, and we must succeed , so we have outlined a plan of success that is broken into phases. During the first phase, the software phase, is the design of the working title,“H.A.L.O.”, which stands for Hardware Assembler Language Open-source . It is to be a hardware description language in pure binary so as to also be able to work as a self bootstrapping self hosting assembly language , capable of addressing any architecture or electronic devices at a bit level , ie bitbanging ,also because it will be in pure binary it will able to utilize neural net and quantum simulated technologies at the hardware level. This binary language will be utilized all the way to the level of kernel and application and will be able to translate directly to ethernet as well as wifi, software defined radio and other networking technologies.
Even though we will use this language to program our kernel and applications, we will continue to use Linux Ubuntu 22.04 as the environment for development until the finalization of the project
